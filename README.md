# Multilayer-perceptron

The goal of this project is to give you a first approach to artificial neural networks,
and to have you implement the algorithms at the heart of the training process. At the
same time you are going to have to get reacquainted with the manipulation of
derivatives and linear algebra as they are indispensable mathematical tools for the
success of the project.
